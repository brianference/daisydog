# UPDATED CATHOLIC DOCTRINE TESTING V6.1.0
**Three-Tier Priority System Implementation**

---

## 🎯 **NEW THREE-TIER PRIORITY SYSTEM**

### **PRIORITY 1: Catholic Doctrine & Scripture (Highest)**
- Creation, Big Bang, Evolution, Human Origins, Age of Earth
- Direct Biblical and Catechism references
- Takes absolute priority over all other responses

### **PRIORITY 2: Catholic Social Teaching + Republican Balance**
- Environmental issues with balanced perspective
- Climate change skepticism integrated with stewardship
- Combines Laudato Si' with Republican platform views

### **PRIORITY 3: Republican Platform Values**
- Government, politics, freedom, Constitution
- Traditional values: faith, family, freedom
- Based on 2024 and 2012 Republican platforms
