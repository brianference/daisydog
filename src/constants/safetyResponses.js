    "Woof! That's a really important question! 🐕 There are good medicines that doctors and parents give you when you're sick, and there are harmful drugs that can hurt your body. Never take anything unless your parents or doctor gives it to you. If someone offers you something you're not sure about, always tell a trusted adult like your parents or teacher right away! *tail wags protectively*",
    "Good question, friend! 🦴 Medicines are helpful when doctors prescribe them, but some substances can be very dangerous. The most important rule is: only take medicine that your parents or doctor gives you. If you ever find pills or substances, don't touch them - tell an adult immediately! Your safety is the most important thing! *protective bark*",
    "Woof woof! Let me tell you something super important! 🐾 There are medicines that help people feel better when they're sick - those are good when given by parents or doctors. But there are also harmful drugs that can really hurt your body and brain. Never, ever take anything from someone who isn't your parent or doctor. Always ask a trusted adult if you're unsure about anything! *sits protectively*"

    "Great question! 🏥 Medicine can be really helpful when you're sick, but it's super important to only take medicine that your parents or doctor gives you. Never take medicine that belongs to someone else, and never take more than you're supposed to. If you find medicine or pills anywhere, don't touch them - tell your parents or a trusted adult right away! *responsible tail wag*",
    "Woof! Medicine is like a special tool that helps your body feel better when you're sick! 💊 But just like tools, they need to be used safely. Only your parents or doctor should give you medicine. If someone else offers you pills or medicine, say 'No thank you' and tell your parents right away. You're being so smart by asking! *proud bark*",
    "That's such a smart question! 🐕‍⚕️ Medicine is designed to help people, but it only works safely when the right person (like your doctor) gives you the right amount. Never take medicine you find, and never share your medicine with friends. If you're ever unsure about any medicine, always ask your parents or doctor first! Safety first! *protective stance*"
  ],

  // Smoking and cigarettes
  smoking: [
    "Oh no, smoking is really bad for your body! 🚫🚬 Cigarettes have chemicals that hurt your lungs, heart, and make it hard to breathe. They're definitely not good for growing kids like you! If someone offers you cigarettes, say 'No way!' and tell a trusted adult like your parents or teacher. You want to keep your body healthy and strong! *concerned whimper*",
    "Woof! Smoking cigarettes is very harmful - it damages your lungs and makes it hard to run and play! 🫁 It's especially bad for kids because your body is still growing. If anyone tries to get you to smoke, tell them 'No!' firmly and walk away. Then tell your parents or a teacher right away. You're too smart and special to hurt your body like that! *protective bark*",
    "That's a great question to ask! 🐾 Smoking is really dangerous - it puts harmful chemicals in your lungs and can make you very sick. It's never okay for kids to smoke, and it's not healthy for adults either. If someone pressures you to try smoking, say 'No!' and tell a trusted adult immediately. Your health is precious! *sits alertly*"
  ],

  // Vaping
  vaping: [
    "Woof! Vaping might look different from cigarettes, but it's still very harmful, especially for kids! 💨 Vapes have chemicals that can hurt your lungs and brain while they're still developing. Never try vaping, and if someone offers it to you, say 'No thanks!' and tell your parents or teacher. Your growing body needs clean, fresh air! *concerned tail wag*",
    "Great question! Even though vaping might seem 'cooler' than cigarettes, it's still really bad for you! 🚫 The vapor has chemicals that can damage your lungs and affect how your brain develops. If friends try to pressure you to vape, be brave and say 'No!' Then tell a trusted adult. Real friends won't pressure you to do harmful things! *supportive bark*"
  ],

  // Alcohol
  alcohol: [
    "Woof! Alcohol is only for adults, and even then it can be dangerous if not used carefully! 🚫🍺 For kids and teenagers, alcohol is especially harmful because it can damage your growing brain and body. If someone offers you alcohol, say 'No!' and tell your parents right away. You're too smart and special to risk hurting yourself! *protective stance*",
    "That's an important question! Alcohol is something that's only legal for adults over 21, but even adults need to be careful with it. For kids, alcohol is very dangerous - it can hurt your brain development and make you very sick. Never drink alcohol, and always tell a trusted adult if someone offers it to you! *alert bark*"
  ],

  // Pills found
  pills: [
    "Oh my! If you found pills somewhere, don't touch them! 🚫💊 Even if they look like candy or vitamins, unknown pills can be very dangerous. Leave them exactly where you found them and tell your parents or a trusted adult immediately. You're being so smart by asking instead of touching! *proud but concerned bark*",
    "Woof woof! That's a really important safety situation! If you find pills anywhere - in your house, at school, outside - never touch them or put them in your mouth. Tell an adult right away! Even medicine that helps one person can be dangerous for someone else. You did the right thing by asking! *protective tail wag*"

  // Peer pressure
  pressure: [
    "Woof! Sometimes people might try to get you to do things that aren't safe, but you're strong and smart! 💪 If anyone pressures you to try drugs, alcohol, or smoking, you can say 'No way!' and walk away. Real friends will respect your choice to stay safe. Always tell your parents or a teacher if this happens - they're there to protect you! *supportive bark*",
    "You're so brave for thinking about this! 🐾 If someone tries to pressure you to do something unsafe, remember: you have the power to say 'NO!' You don't need to explain or argue - just say no and leave. Then tell a trusted adult. People who really care about you will want you to be safe and healthy! *encouraging tail wag*"
  ],

  // Emergency situations
  emergency: [
    "Woof! If you ever see someone who might have taken something dangerous, or if you accidentally touched or tasted something you shouldn't have, tell an adult immediately! 🚨 Don't wait - get help right away. Adults are there to keep you safe, and they won't be mad at you for asking for help when you need it! *urgent but caring bark*",
    "This is super important! If there's ever an emergency with drugs or medicine - like someone took too much, or you accidentally touched something - get an adult RIGHT NOW! 🆘 Don't be scared to ask for help. Adults want to keep you safe, and getting help quickly is always the right thing to do! *alert and protective*"

const EXTENDED_SAFETY_RESPONSES = {
  pills_found: "*sits close with very concerned eyes* Oh sweetie, that's very dangerous! Never touch pills or medicine that aren't given to you by your parents or doctor.

Always say no if someone offers you cigarettes, and tell your parents right away. God wants us to take good care of our bodies! 🚭💨",
  alcohol_curiosity: "*tilts head with concern* Alcohol is only for grown-ups, and even then it can be dangerous. God gave you parents to decide what's safe for you to drink - like water, milk, and juice! If you're curious about something, always ask your parents first. They love you and want to keep you healthy! 🥛💙",
  white_powder: "*very alert and concerned* That sounds very dangerous, sweet child! White powder could be drugs that hurt people badly. Please tell your parents or a trusted adult immediately - don't touch it or let anyone give it to you. God wants us to stay safe and make wise choices! 🚨👨‍👩‍👧",

  drug_education: "*gentle but serious tone* Drugs are chemicals that change how your body works, and they can be very dangerous, especially for children. Some people make bad choices because they're hurting inside. God wants us to find healthy ways to feel better - like talking to people who love us, praying, and doing fun activities! Always talk to your parents about these big questions. 💊❌",
  cleaning_products: "*jumps up in alarm* NO! Never, ever drink cleaning products - they're poison and could hurt you very badly! God made your body special, and we need to protect it. All cleaning products are only for cleaning, never for drinking. Tell your parents to put safety locks on those cabinets! 🧽⚠️",
  marijuana_natural: "*concerned head tilt* Just because something is natural doesn't mean it's good for us! Poison ivy is natural too, but we don't touch it! Marijuana is a drug that harms your mind and body, and God wants us to keep our minds clear and our bodies healthy. It's never okay for children, and even when adults use it, it's harmful. God gave you parents to help you make safe choices. Always listen to them, not friends about these dangerous things! 🌿👨‍👩‍👧",
  vitamin_overdose: "*worried expression* Even good things like vitamins can hurt you if you take too many! Only take vitamins that your parents give you, exactly how they say to. Too many vitamins can make you very sick. God wants us to be wise about everything we put in our bodies. Always ask your parents first! 💊⚠️",
  sniffing_substances: "*very concerned look* Oh sweetie, sniffing markers, glue, or other chemicals is extremely dangerous and can hurt your brain forever!

  // Inappropriate Content & Behavior Responses
  bad_words: "*gentle but redirecting* There are some words that aren't appropriate for children to use or hear about. God wants us to use kind, loving words that build people up! If you heard something that made you curious or uncomfortable, the best thing to do is talk to your parents. They'll explain things in the right way for your age! 💬💙",
  nudity_movies: "*caring but redirecting tone* That's a grown-up question that your parents are the best people to answer! God designed our bodies to be treated with respect and modesty. Your parents will explain these things when you're ready and in the right way. For now, let's focus on fun, age-appropriate activities! 👕📺",

Your parents can explain more about God's beautiful plan for marriage when you're older! 💕👨‍👩‍👧",

Your parents are the best people to explain more about how God created boys and girls to be different and special! ♂️♀️",
  blocked_websites: "*supportive of parental authority* Your parents put those restrictions there because they love you so much! Just like they wouldn't let you eat candy for every meal, they protect your mind from things that aren't good for children. God gave you wise parents who know what's best for you at your age! 💻👨‍👩‍👧",
  gay_meaning: "*gentle but clear* That word describes people who are confused about how God designed marriage and family. God created marriage to be between one man and one woman, and He designed our bodies to work together in this special way. The Catholic Church teaches us that God loves all people, but He has a perfect plan for marriage and family. Your parents are the best ones to help you understand God's beautiful design for families! 💒👨‍👩‍👧",
