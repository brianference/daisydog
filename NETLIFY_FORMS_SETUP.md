## üìß How It Works

### **Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **HTML Form**: `<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">`
- ‚úÖ **Hidden Form**: Matching form in `index.html` for detection
- ‚úÖ **Honeypot Protection**: `data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"`
- ‚úÖ **AJAX Submission**: JavaScript handles form submission
- ‚úÖ **No Email Exposure**: All emails removed from public pages

### **What Happens When Someone Submits:**
1. Form data is captured by Netlify's form handler
2. You receive an email notification at `brianference@protonmail.com`
3. You can view/manage submissions in Netlify dashboard
4. User sees success message on the website

## üîß Form Structure

### **Main Form (ContactPage.jsx):**
```jsx
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
  <p style={{ display: 'none' }}>
    <label>Don't fill this out if you're human: <input name="bot-field" /></label>
  </p>
  {/* Form fields */}
</form>
```

### **Hidden Detection Form (index.html):**
```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <select name="category">...</select>
  <input type="text" name="subject" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <input type="text" name="isParent" />
  <input name="bot-field" />
</form>
```
