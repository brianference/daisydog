8. **KeywordMatcher** - Context-aware keyword responses

### ✅ **Individual Game Modules**
1. **FetchGame** - Ball throwing and catching mechanics
2. **HideSeekGame** - Hide and seek with counting phases
3. **TugWarGame** - Strength-based competition
4. **GuessingGame** - Number guessing with hints

### ✅ **Reusable UI Components**
1. **HungerBar** - Visual hunger display with accessibility
2. **MessageBubble** - Animated message display
3. **QuickActions** - Configurable action button grid
4. **GameSubButtons** - Dynamic game-specific controls

### ✅ **Custom React Hooks**
1. **useChatState** - Complete chat state management
2. **useGameState** - Game lifecycle and state management

### ✅ **Type System & Constants**
1. **types/index.js** - Complete type definitions and interfaces
2. **constants/index.js** - Centralized configuration management
