# CONSOLE SPAM FIX - Version 5.6.2

## Problem Identified
Excessive console logging from video system components causing console spam and performance issues.

## Root Cause
Video components were logging every single video mapping, loading, and playback event without any throttling or debug mode checks.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated useStableVideoIntegration.js
- Added debug mode check: Only logs when `debugMode = true`
- Increased throttling from 2 seconds to 5 seconds
- Logs are now completely disabled unless explicitly enabled

### 2. Updated VideoAssetManager.js
- Added debug mode checks to all emotion mapping logs
- Only logs when `VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true` environment variable is set
- Reduced logging for:
  - Emotion to video mappings
  - Direct mappings
  - Fallback mappings
  - Default mappings

### 3. Updated InlineVideoMessage.jsx
- Added debug mode checks to video loading logs
- Only logs when `VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true` environment variable is set
- Reduced logging for:
  - Video loading events
  - Video ready events
  - Video playback events

## How to Control Logging

### Production Mode (Clean Console)
```bash
# No environment variable needed - logging is disabled by default
npm run dev
```

### Debug Mode (Full Logging)
```bash
# Set environment variable to enable debug logging
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true npm run dev
```

Or add to `.env.local`:
```
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
🎬 Tricks content detected, enabling roll-over video
🎬 Joy content detected, enabling happy video
🎬 Learning content detected, enabling ears-up video
🎬 Dance content detected, enabling dance video
🎬 Loading inline video for emotion: roll-over
🎬 Direct mapping emotion "roll-over" to video "roll-over"
🎬 Mapping emotion "roll-over" to video "roll-over"
✅ Inline video ready for roll-over
🎬 Inline video loaded and starting playback for roll-over
▶️ Inline video playing for roll-over
... (repeated dozens of times)
```

### After Fix (Production Mode):
```
(Clean console - no video spam)
```

### After Fix (Debug Mode):
```
🎬 Tricks content detected, enabling roll-over video
🎬 Loading inline video for emotion: roll-over
🎬 Direct mapping emotion "roll-over" to video "roll-over"
✅ Inline video ready for roll-over
▶️ Inline video playing for roll-over
(Throttled to once every 5 seconds)
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Clean console in production mode
- ✅ Improved performance (less console operations)
- ✅ Better debugging experience when needed
- ✅ Maintains all video functionality
- ✅ Easy to enable debug mode when troubleshooting

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useStableVideoIntegration.js`
- `src/services/VideoAssetManager.js`
- `src/components/InlineVideoMessage.jsx`

## Status: ✅ CONSOLE SPAM ELIMINATED
