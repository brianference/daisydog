# DaisyDog Version Notes - October 3, 2025

## Version 6.2.1 - Critical Game Fixes & Improvements

### üéÆ Game Fixes

#### Checkers
- **AI Turn Fix**: Fixed critical bug where Checkers AI would not take turns after the first move
- **Architecture**: Removed `processingRef` from CheckersBoard (human player) - only needed in CheckersAIBoard
- **Double Jump Support**: Added recursive `findChainCaptures()` function for chain captures
  - Players and AI can now jump over multiple pieces in a single turn
  - Properly validates turn order and game state before moves
- **File Modified**: `src/services/boardgames/CheckersGame.js`

#### Word Scramble
- **Progression Fix**: Fixed game freezing after first word (was stuck at 1/5)
  - Changed `maxMoves` from 1 to 20 to allow multiple letter selections per turn
  - Letters now properly appear for all 5 words with correct state updates
- **Restart Button Fix**: Component now receives and uses `gameKey` prop as key on Client
  - Properly resets game without hiding menu
  - Game remounts completely with fresh state
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/services/boardgames/WordScrambleGame.js`
  - `src/components/boardgames/WordScramble.jsx`

#### Go Fish
- **Auto-Pair Detection**: Added automatic pair detection at setup
  - Pairs are now marked immediately when dealt
  - After pairs removed, cards are auto-drawn to refill hand to 5 cards
  - Hand always maintained at 5 cards until deck exhausted
  - Recursive pair checking during card draws to handle chain pairs
- **File Modified**: `src/services/boardgames/GoFishGame.js`

#### Memory Match
- **Victory Audio Fix**: Background music now properly stops when game ends (WIN/LOSE/DRAW)
  - Victory sounds play correctly (victory.mp3, victoryBark.mp3)
  - Daisy voice announces win/lose using ElevenLabsService
  - Added `stopBackgroundMusic()` to all game-end handlers
- **StateID Error Fix**: Eliminated "invalid stateID" errors (was=[71] expected=[72], etc.)
  - Added triple-check before `endPlayerTurn`: ctxRef.current, ctx.gameover, and ctx.currentPlayer validation
  - Prevents turn ending after game is already over
  - Applied to both AI and human player boards
- **File Modified**: `src/components/boardgames/MemoryMatch.jsx`

#### Global Improvements
- **Restart Button**: All BoardGame.io games now restart properly without hiding menu
  - Removed `setSelectedBoardGame(null)` from restart handler
  - `gameKey` increments to force component re-mount
  - Applied to ALL games: TicTacToe, Connect Four, Memory Match, Checkers, Go Fish, Word Scramble
- **File Modified**: `src/pages/ChatPage.jsx`
