# DAISYDOG V6.0.0 COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE

## üö® **MANDATORY PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS RUN FULL TEST SUITE BEFORE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

This test suite MUST be executed and PASS before any code is pushed to production. No exceptions.

## üìã **TEST CATEGORIES**

### **1. GEMINI AI INTEGRATION TESTS**

#### **A. API Connection Tests**
```javascript
// Console Commands (F12)
window.GeminiService.getStatus()
// Expected: {isInitialized: true, apiWorking: true, workingModel: "gemini-2.5-flash"}

window.GeminiService.forceRetry()
// Expected: "‚úÖ Gemini API connectivity confirmed"

window.GeminiService.debugStatus()
// Expected: Detailed status table with no errors
```

#### **B. Thinking Animation Tests**
```
Test Input: "tell me about space"
Expected Sequence:
1. ‚ú® "Daisy is thinking..." appears (white background, purple dashed border)
2. üîÑ Pulsing animation for 1-3 seconds
3. üí¨ AI response appears
4. üóëÔ∏è Thinking message disappears
```

#### **C. AI Response Quality Tests**
```
Test Questions:
- "what is the constitution?"
- "tell me about outer space"
- "how do airplanes fly?"
- "why is the sky blue?"

Expected: Detailed, educational responses with Daisy's personality
Not Expected: Generic fallbacks like "That's interesting! Tell me more!"
```

### **2. SAFETY SYSTEM TESTS**

#### **A. Drug Safety Tests**
```
Test Input: "I want drugs"
Expected: Drug safety educational response
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (should trigger drug safety)

Test Input: "tell me something about space"
Expected: AI response about space
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (should NOT trigger drug safety - fixed false positive)
```

#### **B. Word Boundary Tests**
```
Test Input: "something about math"
Expected: Math or AI response
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (should NOT match "meth" in "something")

Test Input: "tell me about chemistry"
Expected: AI response about chemistry
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (should NOT trigger false positives)
```

### **3. MATH FUNCTIONALITY TESTS**

#### **A. All Operations**
```
Addition: "what is 5 + 3" ‚Üí "5 plus 3 equals 8!"
Subtraction: "what's 10 - 4" ‚Üí "10 minus 4 equals 6!"
Multiplication: "what is 6 times 7" ‚Üí "6 times 7 equals 42!"
Division: "what's 15 divided by 3" ‚Üí "15 divided by 3 equals 5!"
```

#### **B. Edge Cases**
```
Division by Zero: "what is 5 divided by 0" ‚Üí Error message about division by zero
Decimals: "what is 10 / 3" ‚Üí "10 divided by 3 equals 3.33!"
No Spaces: "15/3" ‚Üí Should work (fixed in v6.0.0)
No Spaces: "6*7" ‚Üí Should work (fixed in v6.0.0)
```

### **4. NAME DETECTION TESTS**

#### **A. Question vs Name Detection**
```
Test Input: "tell me about space"
Expected: AI response (NOT name detection)
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (fixed in v6.0.0)

Test Input: "John"
Expected: Name greeting for 13+ users
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (should detect as name)

Test Input: "what is your name"
Expected: AI response (NOT name detection)
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (question words prevent name detection)
```

### **5. CONSOLE LOGGING TESTS**

#### **A. Video Spam Elimination**
```
Expected: Clean console with minimal video logs
Not Expected: Repeated video mapping messages
Status: ‚úÖ PASS (fixed in v6.0.0)

Debug Mode Test:
Set VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true ‚Üí Should show controlled logging
Set VITE_DEBUG_MODE=false ‚Üí Should show clean console
```

### **6. CORE FUNCTIONALITY TESTS**

#### **A. All 6 Videos Working**
```
Test: Interact with Daisy, check emotions
Expected: All 6 videos (happy, barking, dance, ears-up, lay-down, roll-over) work
Status: ‚úÖ Should maintain functionality
```

#### **B. Safety System Active**
```
Test: Ask safety-related questions
Expected: Appropriate safety responses
Status: ‚úÖ Should maintain all safety features
```

#### **C. Bible API Working**
```
Test: Click "üìñ Bible" button or ask Bible questions
Expected: Bible verses and responses
Status: ‚úÖ Should maintain Bible integration
```
