# DaisyDog - AI Virtual Pet Companion for Kids

## Overview
DaisyDog is an AI-powered virtual companion designed for children aged 5-18. This React + Vite frontend application leverages the Google Gemini AI API and Supabase to deliver a safe, interactive chatbot experience embodied by a friendly golden retriever personality. The project aims to provide engaging and educational content, including interactive games, video responses, and a multi-layered safety system, all within a pure frontend architecture without a dedicated backend server.

## Recent Changes (October 3, 2025)
**Database Decision: Staying with Supabase**
- Attempted PostgreSQL migration but reverted due to browser security limitations
- DATABASE_URL cannot be accessed from browser (server-side only for security)
- @neondatabase/serverless requires Netlify serverless functions (complex refactoring)
- Staying with Supabase for browser-safe database access with existing architecture
- All logging continues via Supabase (sessions, safety_events, performance_logs, voice_transcripts)

**Video Display Improvements:**
- Restored larger video heights in chat messages for better visibility
- Desktop: 280px ‚Üí 320px
- Tablet: 220px ‚Üí 250px  
- Mobile: 200px ‚Üí 220px
- Maintains object-position: center 30% to keep Daisy's head visible

**Game Fixes & Improvements:**
- Memory Match: Fixed Daisy AI showing both card flips (removed playerView stripping)
- Memory Match: Increased card boxes 20% (90px ‚Üí 108px) for better visibility
- Memory Match: Flipped cards show 300% larger emojis (36px ‚Üí 108px)
- Tic-Tac-Toe: Daisy now places paw icons (üêæ) instead of circles (‚óã)
- Word Scramble: Fixed disappearing letters by using unique AnimatePresence keys (targetWord-index-letter)
- Background Music: Fixed async/await in GameContainer.jsx for all games
- All BoardGame.io games now play background music 5 seconds after voice instructions

**Catholic Prayer System Enhancements:**
- Separated Guardian Angel and Bedtime Prayer into distinct prayer topics
- Guardian Angel Prayer: "Angel of God, my guardian dear..." (keywords: guardian angel, angel of god)
- Bedtime Prayer: "God, our Father, I come to say..." (keywords: bedtime prayer, prayer before sleep)
- Fixed prayer ordering in bibleTopics to check specific prayers before generic "prayer" topic
- All prayers now display full traditional text: Hail Mary, Meal Prayer, Guardian Angel, Bedtime Prayer, Our Father
- Bible topics checked BEFORE biblical characters to prevent "Mary" name match override
- Enhanced Debug Control Center with 5 tabs: Games, Voice, Safety, Constitution, Bible/Prayer
- Added automated prayer testing with 5 prayer validation tests

## Previous Changes (October 2, 2025)
**Go Fish Hand Refill & UI Improvements:**
- Added automatic hand refill logic to maintain 5 cards during gameplay
- Refill triggers after pair removal in both askForCard and drawCard moves
- Properly checks for new pairs after each refill card draw
- Changed UI to show "Your Pairs: X" and "Daisy's Pairs: Y" for clarity
- Added .player-info CSS styling to match .opponent-info display
- Refill logic safely handles deck exhaustion without infinite loops

**Memory Match & Tic Tac Toe Height Increases:**
- Memory Match: Added min-height: 650px for better card visibility
- Tic Tac Toe: Added min-height: 550px for improved board display
- Memory Match uses custom AI implementation in MemoryMatchAIBoard component
- AI properly flips two cards with delays (1s ‚Üí flip ‚Üí 1s ‚Üí flip ‚Üí 2.5s ‚Üí endTurn)

**Previous Changes:**
- Go Fish: Changed from 4-of-a-kind "books" to 2-of-a-kind "pairs" (classic Go Fish rules)
- Updated UI terminology from "Books" to "Pairs" throughout
- Implemented proper pair counting logic with `Math.floor(count / 2)`
- Fixed initialization bug with defensive checks (`G.pairs?.['1']?.length || 0`)
- UI Spacing Optimization: Reduced GameContainer padding from 15px to 8px for more compact layout
- Decreased header padding and margins (10px ‚Üí 8px, margin 10px ‚Üí 6px)
- Go Fish specific reductions: board padding 20px ‚Üí 8px, game area gap 30px ‚Üí 12px
- Player hand min-height reduced from 140px to 100px for better space utilization

## User Preferences
### Development Workflow
**MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL:**

**1. Pre-Change Validation (ALWAYS FIRST)**
- Screenshot BEFORE making any UI changes
- Document exact current values (widths, colors, positions, file paths)
- Verify all referenced files actually exist before using them
- Check if routes exist before linking to them

**2. Build Validation (For Production Changes)**
- Run `npm run build` locally to catch build-time issues
- Verify dist/ folder contains all expected files
- Check that all assets and routes are generated
- Test links and images in built output

**3. Link & Asset Checking**
- Manually verify every link points to a real route
- Confirm every image src points to an actual file
- Test with actual file system checks, never assume
- Use data URIs for simple assets when appropriate

**4. Protected Core Files (NEVER DELETE)**
- index.html (Vite entry point)
- package.json (Dependencies)
- vite.config.js (Build config)
- netlify.toml (Deployment config)
- .env files (Environment secrets)
- Always verify file purpose before any deletion

**5. Incremental Testing**
- Make ONE change at a time
- Screenshot immediately after each change
- Compare before/after screenshots side-by-side
- Get user approval before proceeding to next change

**6. Pre-Push Checklist**
- ‚úÖ Screenshot tool shows UI works correctly
- ‚úÖ Console logs are clean (no errors)
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
- ‚úÖ All links and assets verified
- ‚úÖ Architect review passed for code changes
- ‚úÖ User has approved visual changes
