# DaisyDog - AI Virtual Pet Companion for Kids

## Overview
DaisyDog is an AI-powered virtual companion designed for children aged 5-18. This React + Vite frontend application leverages the Google Gemini AI API and Supabase to deliver a safe, interactive chatbot experience embodied by a friendly golden retriever personality. The project aims to provide engaging and educational content, including interactive games, video responses, and a multi-layered safety system, all within a pure frontend architecture without a dedicated backend server.

## User Preferences
### Development Workflow
**MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL:**

**1. Pre-Change Validation (ALWAYS FIRST)**
- Screenshot BEFORE making any UI changes
- Document exact current values (widths, colors, positions, file paths)
- Verify all referenced files actually exist before using them
- Check if routes exist before linking to them

**2. Build Validation (For Production Changes)**
- Run `npm run build` locally to catch build-time issues
- Verify dist/ folder contains all expected files
- Check that all assets and routes are generated
- Test links and images in built output

**3. Link & Asset Checking**
- Manually verify every link points to a real route
- Confirm every image src points to an actual file
- Test with actual file system checks, never assume
- Use data URIs for simple assets when appropriate

**4. Protected Core Files (NEVER DELETE)**
- index.html (Vite entry point)
- package.json (Dependencies)
- vite.config.js (Build config)
- netlify.toml (Deployment config)
- .env files (Environment secrets)
- Always verify file purpose before any deletion

**5. Incremental Testing**
- Make ONE change at a time
- Screenshot immediately after each change
- Compare before/after screenshots side-by-side
- Get user approval before proceeding to next change

**6. Pre-Push Checklist**
- ‚úÖ Screenshot tool shows UI works correctly
- ‚úÖ Console logs are clean (no errors)
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
- ‚úÖ All links and assets verified
- ‚úÖ Architect review passed for code changes
- ‚úÖ User has approved visual changes

## System Architecture
DaisyDog is built as a React 18 + Vite 6 frontend with **Netlify serverless functions** for secure backend operations. **Framer Motion** is integrated for UI animations, enhancing the interactive experience. The application uses **Google Gemini AI** for conversational capabilities, **OpenAI Whisper & TTS** for voice features, and **Supabase** for database operations. Styling is handled with **CSS3** focusing on responsive design. **React Router v6** manages client-side navigation. The project incorporates a comprehensive **multi-layered safety system** and integrates **educational content**. Core features include:
- Safe AI chat with child-appropriate responses.
- **9 BoardGame.io Visual Interactive Games** with full AI opponents (Daisy):
  - **Two-Player Strategy Games:** Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Memory Match, Checkers, Go Fish
  - **Single-Player Puzzle Games:** Simple Puzzle, Color Matching, Pattern Builder, Word Scramble
  - Modern & Clean theme (blue palette) with smooth animations
  - Proper turn management with `events.endTurn()` pattern
  - BoardWrapper pattern for theme and event handler integration
- Interactive legacy games with dynamic action buttons for gameplay:
  - **Fetch** - Classic ball throwing game
  - **Tug of War** - Strength competition with pull mechanics
  - **Guessing Game** - Number guessing with hint system
  - **Hide & Seek** - Dual-mode Forest Adventure with sophisticated mechanics:
    - Mode 1: Player hides (4 hiding spots with visibility ratings, AI-driven seeking behavior)
    - Mode 2: Player seeks (hot/cold distance feedback, hint system, progressive difficulty)
    - Phase-based state machine with safe transitions
- **Voice Features** with OpenAI Audio API:
  - Speech-to-text using Whisper for voice input
  - Text-to-speech with Shimmer voice (child-friendly female voice) for responses
  - Clean text processing (removes emojis, formatting, and prompts before TTS)
  - Sound effects disabled during voice conversations to prevent interruption
  - HMAC token-based authentication for security
  - Rate limiting (10 requests/min per session)
  - Auto-start recording on microphone button click
  - 30-second maximum recording duration
- Video responses with emotional expressions and sound effects.
- Hunger and energy management system for the virtual pet.
- A robust testing system including constitutional content validation, UI button pattern checks, and game action verification.
- Mobile optimization ensures a consistent user experience across various devices.
- Video assets are managed to support both landscape and portrait aspect ratios, displayed within chat bubbles rather than avatars.
- Submenus for games and other quick actions are correctly positioned to ensure visibility and proper interaction flow.
