The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by the `vite` command not being found during the build process, resulting in a non-zero exit code.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that `vite` is installed and available in the project dependencies. Since `vite` appears to be the build tool, run the following command to add it to the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install vite --save-dev
```
After adding `vite` to the dependencies, redeploy the project to Netlify to see if the issue is resolved.
