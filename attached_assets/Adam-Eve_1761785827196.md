- [Hisss Game Cards 2](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzoU-u0yaTng5EbdOaNfYS1KCSSm0_GqcGH5UiJpbqPHWSsWkD-BgLZcmuCJAj_8yJtDY1c9dGneb10Wde_KuRhxL6DrXOaBDe9tx1_lFJ67HaIpHbYfVqQb5Ml76GTW2xBjFmrODveeb0NvQ/s1600-h/HisssGameCards2.png)  

Place the cards in a stack face down in the middle of the playing area. The first player draws a card and places it face up on the playing area. Going clockwise the next player draws a card and if it matches the first card to make a snake of the same color, they place the card next to it so they are touching. If you can place a head or tail card to complete a snake, you win that snake. Say “Hisss!” and slide it in front of you. The snakes you win form your snake pit. If the card does not match, lay it face up in the playing area to start a new snake. Play continues clockwise with each player drawing one card, either matching it to a “snake-under construction” or starting a new snake if there is no color match. The player with the most completed snakes wins.
