What Lamb Is Missing?

Need: Nothing

Directions: Students sit in a group on the floor. One student is “It” and must turn around and hide their eyes. Another student is picked by the teacher and they go outside of the room. “It” then must guess what lamb is missing. Whoever was the lost lamb is now “It”.

Herding Sheep Game

Need: Balloons and a staff

Pick one student and have them stand beside you in front of the class. Place an empty box on its side at the opposite end of the room.

Say: Let's practice being shepherds. First we need some sheep. Let's pretend these are sheep. (Put 1 balloon on the floor in front of the student). Here is your shepherd's staff (hand student a staff). Take your staff and herd your sheep into the pen (the empty box turned on its side). Hold your staff pointing down so no one gets poked, and be careful you don't pop the sheep! Guide it gently – don’t push it from behind, but stand in front of it and coax it along. (Encourage student as they guide their sheep.)

Say: This is not a race, we just want each person to have a turn. When you get your sheep in the pen, pick it up and walk back to me and give me the staff and the sheep.

When each student has had a turn, ask the following questions:

- Was it easy to make your sheep go where you wanted them to go?
- Do you think it's easy for shepherds to get sheep to go where the shepherds want them to go? Why or why not?
- It's hard to make balloons go where we want them to go, and it's even harder to take care of sheep because they sometimes run away or get lost.
- Do you remember our story from today?
- Who did it say is our shepherd? (The Lord, Jesus)
- Who are the sheep? (us)
  Say: Jesus is our Good Shepherd, so when we follow him, we won't ever get lost.
- Do you think that Jesus is happy when we choose to follow him? Why or why not?
