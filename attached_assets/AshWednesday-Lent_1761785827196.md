[Lent Word Wall](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ar6LKlEjjtdHz3Ps7LOiggUueboW) Word wall templates are large flash card printables that you can hang on the wall to aid children when they are learning or using new vocabulary words. (Explain each card to the children. Example: Ash Wednesday- What is happening in this picture? The priest is putting blessed ashes in the shape of a cross on the boy’s forehead. This happens on Ash Wednesday. Pray- What is happening in this picture? We pray more during Lent. Fast- What is this a picture of? Would you normally have more than a hotdog for lunch or dinner? What would you have? To fast means to eat less or to go without certain foods. Give- What is happening in this picture? The boy wants to give his teacher an apple. During Lent we should try and do more good things for others.)

**Plan:**

### Circle Time:

1. **Ash Wednesday** (write it on the board or hold up Word Wall card)  
   Ash Wednesday is the beginning of Lent. On Ash Wednesday, blessed ashes are put on your forehead in the shape of a cross. These ashes are made by burning palm leaves which have been saved from last year’s Palm Sunday.  
   Ash Wednesday is also when we begin to do penance for Lent. Penance is something that you do or are given to do in order to show that you are sad or sorry about doing something wrong. We do this to improve our relationship with God and others. The Church suggests three special practices of penance for Lent:  
   (Write the bold words on the board or hold up Word Wall card).  
- **Pray** - go to Mass more often, pray more often.  
  During Lent the Stations of the Cross are said at our church every Friday. My family goes to this every Friday during Lent.  
  Can you think of other ideas?  

- **Fast** - going without food or eating less. It can also mean giving up a certain food or treat.  
  My husband is giving up Diet Coke during Lent. My son is eating less sweets during Lent.  
  Can you think of other ideas?  
  During Lent people older than you must do abstinence which means not to eat meat. They do not to eat meat on Fridays during Lent and on Ash Wednesday. What can they eat? They can eat fish and other seafood, vegetables, eggs, milk and other dairy products.  

- **Almsgiving** - means doing good for others. That can be giving gifts of money or help to others.  
  The money my husband does not spend for Diet Cokes he will collect. At the end of Lent he will give the money to the poor.  
  Can you think of other ideas?
2. **What is Lent?** (write it on the board or hold up Word Wall card)  
   Lent is a time to pray, fast, and give alms. Lent is the 40 days before Easter. It starts on Ash Wednesday and ends on the Thursday before Good Friday. Lent is a time to prepare for Easter. During Lent we remember that Jesus went into the desert for 40 days and fasted. Jesus was tempted by the devil, but he did not give in. We try to be like Jesus during Lent. We try to pray, fast, and give alms.
