The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to missing files when trying to load `sad.png` and `/chat` under the `dist` directory.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `sad.png` file is present in the `dist/assets/images/emotions/` directory. If the file is missing, make sure it is added to the correct location.
2. Check if the `/chat` route exists in the `dist` directory. If it's missing, ensure that the necessary files are generated and placed in the correct location to support the `/chat` route.
