## **GAMEPLAY - STEP BY STEP**

### **Starting the Game**
1. Players look at their own cards (keep hidden from opponent)
2. Check for any pairs in your hand immediately
3. If you have pairs, place them face-up in front of you (score pile)
4. Decide who goes first (youngest player, coin flip, or mutual agreement)

### **On Your Turn (Logical Sequence)**

**STEP 1: Ask for Cards**
- You MUST have at least one card of the rank you're asking for
- Choose one rank from your hand
- Ask opponent: "Do you have any [rank]?" (e.g., "Do you have any 7s?")

**STEP 2: Opponent's Response**

**Option A - Opponent HAS the card(s):**
- Opponent must give you ALL cards of that rank
- Add cards to your hand
- Check if you now have a pair
- If you made a pair, place it face-up in your score pile
- **Important**: You get another turn! Repeat from Step 1

**Option B - Opponent DOES NOT have the card:**
- Opponent says "Go Fish!"
- Proceed to Step 3

**STEP 3: Go Fish (Draw from Stock)**
- Draw the top card from the stock pile
- Look at the card you drew

**Two Possibilities:**

**A. You drew the rank you asked for:**
- Add it to your hand
- Check for pairs, place any pairs in your score pile
- **You get another turn!** Repeat from Step 1

**B. You drew a different rank:**
- Add it to your hand
- Check for pairs, place any pairs in your score pile
- **Your turn ends**
- Opponent takes their turn

---

### **Special Situations**

**If your hand is empty:**
- Draw 1 card from the stock pile
- Your turn ends
- Opponent's turn begins

**If the stock pile is empty:**
- Continue playing with cards in hand
- If you have no cards and stock is empty, you're out of the game
- Other player continues playing alone or game ends

## **WINNING THE GAME**

**Game ends when:**
1. All 26 pairs have been made (entire deck is paired), OR
2. No cards remain in stock pile AND no valid moves can be made

**Determining the Winner:**
- Count the pairs in front of each player
- Player with the MOST pairs wins
- If tied, it's a draw

## **KEY RULES SUMMARY**
