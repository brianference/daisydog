Best Testing Improvements for Replit.com Projects
1. Set Up Jest with React Testing Library

Why: Industry standard for React testing, works well in Replit
Setup: Add to package.json dependencies and create jest.config.js
Focus: Component testing, user interactions, safety filters

2. Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD (Free Tier)

Why: Replit has limited testing UI, GitHub Actions provides robust automation
Strategy:

Connect Replit to GitHub repository
Run tests on every push/PR
Automated safety compliance checks
Performance benchmarks



3. Prioritize Safety-Critical Testing
Given DaisyDog's child-focused nature:

Age verification flows (100% coverage required)
Content safety filters (drug safety, inappropriate content)
COPPA compliance checks
Parent dashboard access controls

4. Use Replit's Built-in Testing Features

Unit Tests Tab: Configure to run Jest tests
Environment Variables: Store test API keys separately
Secrets: Never expose Claude API keys in tests

5. Implement Test Coverage Tracking

Tool: Istanbul/nyc (works in Replit)
Target: 80% minimum coverage
Critical: 100% coverage for safety components

6. Create Testing Layers
Layer 1 - Unit Tests (70%)

Individual component testing
Custom hooks (useSafetyFilter, useChatState)
Utility functions

Layer 2 - Integration Tests (20%)

Chat flow with safety filters
Game interactions
Parent dashboard features

Layer 3 - E2E Tests (10%)

Playwright or Cypress
Complete user journeys
Age verification → game play → safety trigger

7. Replit-Specific Testing Setup
Best practices:
.replit file configuration:
run = "npm test -- --watchAll=false --ci"
Test scripts in package.json:
json"test": "jest --coverage",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:safety": "jest --testPathPattern=safety",
"test:coppa": "jest --testPathPattern=coppa",
"test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2"
8. Mock External Dependencies

Claude API: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker)
Video responses: Mock file loading
Analytics: Mock tracking calls
Reduces: API costs during testing

9. Accessibility Testing

jest-axe: Automated a11y testing
Target: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
Critical: All child-facing interfaces must pass

10. Performance Testing in Replit

Lighthouse CI: Automated performance audits
Bundle size checks: Keep under 500KB
Load time monitoring: Target <2s
Memory leak detection: Chrome DevTools in headless mode

11. Create Test Data Fixtures
/tests
  /fixtures
    - safe-messages.json
    - unsafe-messages.json
    - saint-data.json
    - parent-dashboard-data.json
12. Snapshot Testing for UI Consistency

React component snapshots
Prevents regression in child-friendly interfaces
Safety response UI must remain consistent

13. Error Boundary Testing

Test all error scenarios
Ensure child-friendly error messages
Verify parent notifications trigger

14. Continuous Monitoring Setup
Even in Replit:

Sentry: Error tracking (free tier)
LogRocket: Session replay for debugging
Google Analytics: Usage patterns

15. Testing Documentation
Create /docs/testing-guide.md:

How to run tests locally in Replit
Safety testing protocols
COPPA compliance checklist
Test coverage requirements

Recommended Testing Workflow

Pre-commit: Run safety tests (Husky hooks)
On Push to GitHub: Full test suite via Actions
Before Deploy: E2E tests + performance audit
Post-Deploy: Smoke tests + monitoring alerts
