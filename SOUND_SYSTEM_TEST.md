  window.playTestSound('dog', 'happyBark')
}
```

### **2. Manual Testing Steps:**

4. **Test mute button** - should toggle sound on/off
5. **Click quick action buttons** - should hear click sounds
6. **Feed Daisy** - should hear eating sound

## üîß **Fixing Sound Issues:**

### **Option 1: Replace Corrupted Files**
Replace the small/corrupted sound files with proper audio:

**Required Files:**
```
public/sounds/games/ball-bounce.mp3 (needs replacement - currently 324 bytes)
public/sounds/eating/crunchy-treats.mp3 (needs replacement - currently 324 bytes)
```

**File Requirements:**
- Format: MP3
- Size: 50KB - 200KB (not 324 bytes!)
- Duration: 0.5 - 2 seconds
- Quality: 44.1kHz, 128kbps

### **Option 2: Use Existing Working Files**
Update SoundService.js to use the working files:
```javascript
// In SoundService.js, update the sound mappings:
games: {
  ballBounce: '/sounds/dog/mixkit-ball-bouncing-to-a-stop-2089.wav', // Use existing file
  // ... other mappings
},
eating: {
  crunchyTreats: '/sounds/eating/crunchy-treats2.mp3', // Use the larger file
  // ... other mappings
}
```

### **Option 3: Download Free Sound Files**
Get replacement sounds from:
- **Freesound.org** (Creative Commons licensed)
- **Zapsplat.com** (free with account)
- **YouTube Audio Library**
- **Adobe Audition** built-in sounds

## üéØ **Sound File Sources & Recommendations:**

### **Ball Bounce Sound:**
- Search: "ball bounce", "rubber ball", "tennis ball bounce"
- Duration: 0.5-1 second
- Should sound like a tennis ball bouncing

### **Eating Sound:**
- Search: "dog eating", "crunching treats", "kibble eating"
- Duration: 1-2 seconds  
- Should sound like a dog crunching treats

### **Additional Game Sounds Needed:**
```

/sounds/games/tug-success.mp3
/sounds/games/hide-start.mp3
/sounds/games/hide-found.mp3
/sounds/games/guess-correct.mp3
/sounds/games/guess-wrong.mp3
