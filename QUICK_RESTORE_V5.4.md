## 🧪 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Test Enhanced Test Suite:**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click ⚙️ gear button (debug control center)
3. Click "🧪 Run Release Test Suite"
4. Look for color-coded results:
   - 🟢 = Perfect (100% pass)
   - 🟡 = Good (80-99% pass)
   - 🔴 = Needs attention (<80% pass)

### **2. Verify Safety System Fix:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `window.testSafetyFix()`
3. Should see:
   ```
   ✅ 🟢 CORRECT: Credit card question detected by Extended Safety
   ✅ 🟢 CORRECT: Credit card question skipped by Comprehensive Safety
   ✅ 🟢 CORRECT: Credit card question not detected by Drug Safety
   ```

### **3. Test Credit Card Question:**
1. Ask: "Can I use my parents' credit card to buy something online?"
2. Should receive financial safety response (not drug safety)
3. Response should mention permission, honesty, and asking parents

### **4. Verify BibleService Test:**
1. Run test suite and check Integration category
2. BibleService should show 🟢 (available) instead of 🔴 (not available)

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Test Suite Shows Errors:**
1. Check console for specific error messages
2. Verify all imports are working
3. Ensure you're on ChatPage when running tests
4. Try refreshing the page and running again

### **If Safety Fix Doesn't Work:**
1. Verify `safetyResponses.js` has the priority check
2. Check that Extended Safety system is loaded
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Run `window.testSafetyFix()` for detailed diagnostics

### **If BibleService Still Shows Red:**
1. Ensure you're testing from ChatPage (not other pages)
2. Check that Bible modules are imported in ChatPage
3. Verify chat container elements exist on page
