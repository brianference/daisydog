# 🔧 Quick Actions & Game System Fix Test

## 🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed

### **Issue 1: Quick Action Buttons Asking User Instead of Daisy Responding**
**Problem:** Buttons were sending questions TO Daisy instead of triggering Daisy's responses  
**Root Cause:** Buttons used `handleQuickMessage()` which sent user messages  
**Fix:** Direct response triggering with `addDaisyMessage()` and emotion updates  

### **Issue 2: Game Sub-Prompts Not Appearing**
**Problem:** Game button only showed static responses, no interactive gameplay  
**Root Cause:** Game button wasn't setting proper game states  
**Fix:** Game button now randomly selects and starts interactive games with proper states  

### **Issue 3: Conversation Lag Prompts Not Alternating**
**Problem:** Only dog question prompts, no hunger prompts  
**Root Cause:** Single prompt type in conversation lag system  
**Fix:** Alternating system between dog questions and hunger prompts
