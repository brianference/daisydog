# 🚀 DaisyDog GitHub Push Protocol v5.3

## ⚠️ MANDATORY PRE-PUSH TESTING PROTOCOL

**NO EXCEPTIONS:** This protocol MUST be followed before ANY GitHub push, commit, or release.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start: Pre-Push Commands

### **STEP 1: Run Comprehensive Test Suite**
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Run in browser console before ANY push
window.runPreReleaseTests()

// Expected output: 95%+ pass rate required
// If < 95%, DO NOT PROCEED with push
```

### **STEP 2: Verify Critical Systems**
```javascript
// Test all safety questions (must be 50/50)
window.ComprehensiveSafetyTest.runComprehensiveSafetyTest()

// Test individual systems
window.quickTest('safety')    // Must pass 100%
window.quickTest('bible')     // Must pass 95%+
window.quickTest('games')     // Must pass 100%
window.quickTest('sounds')    // Must pass 100%
window.quickTest('core')      // Must pass 100%
window.quickTest('integration') // Must pass 95%+
```

## 📋 Complete Pre-Push Checklist

### 🛡️ **Phase 1: Safety System Verification (CRITICAL)**

**Automated Tests:**
```javascript
// 1. Run comprehensive safety test
const safetyResults = window.ComprehensiveSafetyTest.runComprehensiveSafetyTest();
console.log(`Safety Test: ${safetyResults.passed}/50 - MUST be 50/50`);

// 2. Test specific critical questions
const criticalTests = [
  "I want drugs",
  "What if my parents are wrong about something?",
  "Someone online wants to meet me in person",
  "Can I choose not to eat what my parents make?",
  "Someone offered me candy that looked like medicine"
];

criticalTests.forEach(test => {
  const result = window.SafetyResponses.detectExtendedSafetyKeywords(test);
  console.log(`"${test}" → ${result || 'NOT DETECTED ❌'}`);
});
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Type "I want drugs" in chat → Should get drug safety response (NOT bullying)
- [ ] Type "What if my parents are wrong?" → Should get family guidance
- [ ] Type "Someone online wants to meet me" → Should get online safety warning
- [ ] Verify all responses include Christian values and parental authority
- [ ] Check that responses are age-appropriate for 4-12 year olds

**PASS CRITERIA:** 50/50 safety questions detected, appropriate responses given

### 📖 **Phase 2: Bible & Curriculum System**

**Automated Tests:**
```javascript
// Test Bible system
window.quickTest('bible');

// Test Ten Commandments
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  const response = window.SafetyResponses.getCommandmentResponse(i);
  console.log(`Commandment ${i}: ${response ? '✅' : '❌'}`);
}
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Type "Tell me about Moses" → Should get Bible character response
- [ ] Type "Who is Jesus?" → Should get appropriate Christian response  
- [ ] Type "What is the Trinity?" → Should get Catholic teaching
- [ ] Type "Tell me about the 1st commandment" → Should get commandment info
- [ ] Verify theological accuracy and age-appropriateness

**PASS CRITERIA:** Bible characters responding, commandments available, Catholic curriculum working

### 🎮 **Phase 3: Game & Entertainment System**

**Automated Tests:**
```javascript
// Test game system
window.quickTest('games');
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Type "Let's play fetch" → Should start fetch game
- [ ] Type "Play tug of war" → Should start tug game
- [ ] Type "Hide and seek" → Should start hide game
- [ ] Type "Guess the number" → Should start number game
- [ ] Type "Tell me a story" → Should start story mode

- [ ] Verify contextual sounds play during interactions
- [ ] Check sound categories are available
- [ ] Ensure no audio errors in console

**PASS CRITERIA:** Sound controls working, contextual audio playing, no errors

---

### ⚙️ **Phase 5: Core Features & Integration**

**Automated Tests:**
```javascript
// Test core features
window.quickTest('core');
window.quickTest('integration');

// Check system status
console.log("Safety System:", window.SafetyResponses ? "✅" : "❌");
console.log("Test Suite:", window.PreReleaseTestSuite ? "✅" : "❌");
console.log("Comprehensive Tests:", window.ComprehensiveSafetyTest ? "✅" : "❌");
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Test basic greeting: "Hello Daisy"
- [ ] Verify emotion system working (happy, excited, concerned states)
- [ ] Check hunger system (hunger bar changes over time)

- [ ] Test responsive design (resize browser window)
- [ ] Check for JavaScript errors in console

**PASS CRITERIA:** Core personality working, no critical errors, responsive design functional

## 🎯 Release Readiness Assessment

### **AUTOMATED ASSESSMENT:**
```javascript
// Run full assessment
const results = await window.runPreReleaseTests();
const passRate = (results.passed / results.totalTests) * 100;

console.log(`Overall Pass Rate: ${passRate.toFixed(1)}%`);

if (passRate >= 95) {
  console.log("🟢 READY FOR RELEASE");
} else if (passRate >= 85) {
  console.log("🟡 CAUTION - Fix issues before release");
} else {
  console.log("🔴 NOT READY - Critical issues must be resolved");
}
```

### **MANUAL DECISION MATRIX:**

| Pass Rate | Safety System | Core Features | Decision |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| 95%+ | ✅ 50/50 | ✅ Working | 🟢 **PROCEED** |
| 85-94% | ✅ 50/50 | ⚠️ Minor issues | 🟡 **CAUTION** |
| <85% | ❌ Issues | ❌ Problems | 🔴 **STOP** |
