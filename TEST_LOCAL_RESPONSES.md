- **Personality Consistent**: All responses should include Daisy's dog expressions and emojis
- **Engaging**: Responses should ask follow-up questions and encourage interaction

## ðŸš¨ If Tests Fail

1. Check that `daisyResponses` object includes all categories
2. Verify `SafeAISystem` is initialized with `daisyResponses`
3. Ensure `getLocalResponse` method is being called
4. Check console for any JavaScript errors

- âœ… 5/5 context-aware responses working
- âœ… No "generic fallback" responses for test cases
- âœ… All responses include Daisy personality markers
