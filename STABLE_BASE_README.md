// STABLE DAISYDOG FOUNDATION - KEEP THIS AS BASE
// This version is proven to work without console errors
// Add advanced features incrementally, testing after each addition

‚úÖ STABLE COMPONENTS (working):
- Basic React (useState only)
- Simple message system
- Clean input handling
- Professional header
- Responsive CSS
- Error-free console

‚ö†Ô∏è ADVANCED FEATURES TO ADD CAUTIOUSLY:
- Sound system (test after adding)
- Hunger system (test after adding)
- Game mechanics (test after adding)
- AI responses (test after adding)
- Animations (test after adding)

üõë NEVER ADD THESE (they cause recurring errors):
- framer-motion dependencies
- Complex useEffect chains
- External data file dependencies
- Multiple state management systems
- Unnecessary third-party libraries

RULE: Add ONE feature at a time, test thoroughly, revert if it breaks.
