## 🧪 **Testing Commands:**

### **System Health Check:**
```javascript
// Check all video files
window.checkVideoFiles()
// Expected: 2/5 available (lay-down, roll-over)

// Test video system
window.quickTest('videos')
// Expected: Some tests pass, some fail due to missing files

// Full test suite
window.runPreReleaseTests()
```

### **Individual Video Tests:**
```javascript
// Test each video type
window.StableVideoIntegration.analyze({text: "I want drugs"})
// Expected: {videoEmotion: "barking", priority: "high", confidence: 1.0}

window.StableVideoIntegration.analyze({text: "I'm tired and want to rest peacefully"})
// Expected: {videoEmotion: "lay-down", priority: "low", confidence: 0.7}

window.StableVideoIntegration.analyze({text: "Show me a silly trick performance"})
// Expected: {videoEmotion: "roll-over", priority: "low", confidence: 0.7}
```

## 📊 **Current Status:**

### **✅ Working (2/5 Videos):**
- **lay-down.mp4** - Fully functional with calm emotion mapping
- **roll-over.mp4** - Fully functional with tricks emotion mapping

### **❌ Missing (3/5 Videos):**
- **barking.mp4** - Will fallback to nervous.png image
- **ears-up.mp4** - Will fallback to curious.png image  
- **happy.mp4** - Will fallback to happy.png image

### **🔊 Audio System:**
- **All sounds work** regardless of video availability
- **Global 2-second cooldown** prevents sound spam
- **Emotion-appropriate sounds** for each video type

## 🚀 **Deployment Ready:**

### **Fault-Tolerant Design:**
- ✅ **Missing videos don't break the system**
- ✅ **Automatic fallback to images**
- ✅ **Sounds still play appropriately**
- ✅ **Console logging for debugging**

### **Production Behavior:**
```
User: "I'm tired and want to rest peacefully"
→ Analysis: {videoEmotion: "lay-down", confidence: 0.7}
→ Video: lay-down.mp4 plays ✅
→ Sound: Calm sound plays once ✅
→ Result: Full audio-visual experience

User: "I want drugs"  
→ Analysis: {videoEmotion: "barking", confidence: 1.0}
→ Video: barking.mp4 missing → fallback to nervous.png ⚠️
→ Sound: Nervous sound plays once ✅
→ Result: Image + sound (graceful degradation)
```
