# DaisyDog v1.6.0 Release Notes
## "Chat Fixes & Deployment Improvements"

**Release Date:** September 16, 2025  
**Version:** 1.6.0  
**Theme:** Critical Chat Functionality Fixes and Enhanced Deployment Process

---

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fixes

### **Fixed Broken Chat Functionality**
- **Issue:** Quick action buttons were not working properly on live site
- **Root Cause:** Buttons were calling `addDaisyMessage()` directly instead of `handleQuickMessage()`
- **Impact:** User messages weren't appearing in chat, making conversation seem broken
- **Fix:** Updated all quick action buttons to use proper `handleQuickMessage()` flow

### **Resolved JavaScript Runtime Errors**
- **Issue:** `logApiStatus is not a function` and React component errors
- **Root Cause:** Missing OpenAI API key causing SafeAISystem initialization failures
- **Fix:** Added proper API key configuration and error handling

## 🔧 Quick Action Button Fixes

### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
<button onClick={() => {
  addDaisyMessage(randomStory)
  setCurrentEmotion('thinking')
}}>
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
<button onClick={() => handleQuickMessage("Tell me a story")}>
```

### **Buttons Fixed:**
- 📚 Tell me a story
- 😄 Tell a joke
