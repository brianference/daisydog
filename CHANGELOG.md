# DaisyDog Changelog

## v6.4.0 - Game Action Button System & Interactive Gameplay (Sept 30, 2025)

### 🎮 CRITICAL FIX: Full Interactive Gameplay Restored

**Problem Solved:** Games now display action buttons for actual gameplay instead of just showing submenu options and ending immediately.

### ✨ New Features

#### Game Action Button System
- Added `activeGameActions` state to track current game action buttons
- Game action buttons conditionally replace quick actions during active gameplay
- Seamless UI flow: Submenu → Game starts → Action buttons appear → Gameplay → Game ends → Normal UI returns

#### Interactive Buttons by Game

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**ChatPage.jsx**
- Added `activeGameActions` state (line 41)
- Implemented `handleGameActionClick()` handler (lines 195-197)
- Game actions set when game starts (lines 414-416)
- Game actions cleared when game ends (line 234)
- Conditional UI rendering (lines 1678-1762)

**Game Architecture**
- Button clicks route through: `handleGameActionClick()` → `handleSendMessage()` → `GameManager.processGameInput()`
- Each game class provides `getAvailableActions()` method
- Actions update dynamically based on game state

### 🧪 Testing Enhancements

- Added game action button tests to preReleaseTestSuite (v6.4.0)
- Created standalone `window.testGameActions()` for interactive testing
- Tests verify buttons appear, replace quick actions, and execute properly

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated replit.md with complete game action button system details
- Documented UI flow and architecture changes
- Added game-specific action button mappings
