1. Open DaisyDog application
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Ensure user age is set (triggers session creation)
4. Wait for all services to initialize

console.log("Catholic Doctrine:", window.CatholicDoctrineService.getStatus())
```

### **Step 3: Execute Database Tests**
```javascript
console.log("=== DATABASE TESTS ===")
console.log("Session:", window.SupabaseService.getCurrentSession())
console.log("Privacy:", window.SupabaseService.verifyPrivacy())
