## 🎉 **VERSION 5.1 OVERVIEW**

Version 5.1 is a **critical patch release** that fixes major bugs discovered in Version 5.0. This release maintains all v5.0 features while resolving critical issues with Bible verse detection, dance music, game system, and random verse variety.

---

## 🔧 **CRITICAL BUG FIXES**

### **1. 📖 Bible Verse Detection Fixed**
**Issue:** Specific Bible verses like "Tell me about Matthew 19:14" and "Tell me about John 3:16" were returning generic responses.
**Fix:** 
- Added `containsSpecificVerseKeywords()` and `getSpecificVerseResponse()` integration
- Fixed detection priority: Specific verses → Bible passages → Bible topics → Bible characters
- All specific Bible verses now work properly

### **2. 🎵 Dance Music Integration Fixed**
**Issue:** Dance requests were not playing the dance-sound.mp3 file.
**Fix:**
- Changed from `playContextualSound('dance')` to `playUISound('dance')`
- Proper sound mapping: `dance: 'danceMusic'` → `dance-sound.mp3`
- Complete dance flow: Music plays → 3-second emotion → auto-reset

### **3. 🎮 Game System Restoration**
**Issue:** Game functions were missing, causing "function is not defined" errors.
**Fix:**
- Restored all game handler functions: `handleFetchGame`, `handleHideSeekGame`, `handleTugWarGame`, `handleGuessingGame`, `handleBallCatchGame`
- Added game state integration in `generateDaisyResponse`
- All games now work without errors

### **4. 🔄 Random Verse Variety Fixed**
**Issue:** Random verse button was always showing John 3:16 due to limited fallback verses.
**Fix:**
- Expanded fallback verses from 2 to 8 child-friendly verses
- Proper randomization ensures variety
- Verses: John 3:16, Psalm 23:1, Matthew 19:14, Psalm 139:14, Jeremiah 29:11, Philippians 4:13, Proverbs 3:5, 1 John 4:19
